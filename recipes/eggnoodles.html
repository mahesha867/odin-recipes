    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>These egg noodles are the old-fashioned type, just like Grammy used to make! Try them next time you prepare your favorite soup or stew. Don't forget that fresh pasta cooks much quicker than dried! You may use a dough hook attachment on your electric mixer or your hands to knead the pasta dough.</p>
